# UXP File Dialog Example

A simple panel with just one button. On click, a file dialog opens and the chosen file's name is shown in the panel. This works fine using manifest version V4.


HOWEVER if manifest version 5 is used (rename manifest.json to manifest_v4.json and manifest_v5.json to mainfest.json) the file dialog is NOT shown.

My Operating system: Windows 10
Photoshop version: 24.4.1
